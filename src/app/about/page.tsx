                    Hey there! I'm Fellipe Lorram, a web developer based in the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I'm truly passionate about all things computer science, from the nitty-gritty technical aspects to the thought-provoking philosophical discussions that arise from it.

                    When it comes to building awesome web applications, I've got you covered. I work with a bunch of cool tools like Typescript, HTML, CSS, Python, Node.js, and React.js. With these under my belt, I'm ready to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

                    You'll often find me diving deep into problems, fueled by hard work and intense focus. I believe that the key to finding the best solutions lies in dedicating myself wholeheartedly to the task at hand. No shortcuts here!

                    Over the years, I've gained solid experience in a range of technologies. I'm well-versed in Vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Typescript, Single Page Applications, Python, Git, MongoDB, and various React libraries like Redux, Router, Framer-Motion, Styled Components, and Next.js. These tools have become second nature to me, allowing me to bring ideas to life with confidence.

                    I've spent three awesome years building autonomous applications, where I've had the freedom to unleash my creativity and craft solutions independently. But that's not all! I've also had the opportunity to work with a CRM company for over a year. During that time, I led a fantastic team focused on platform integrations, Salesforce development, and front-end wizardry. It's been an exciting journey, and I've learned a ton along the way.

                    When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, you'll likely find me exploring the breathtaking wonders of nature, indulging in my hobbies, or engaging with fellow tech enthusiasts at meetups and conferences. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are incredibly important to me, as I firmly believe that together, we can achieve incredible things.

                    While I'm proud of my technical degree in computer science, I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow. That's why I'm constantly seeking out online courses and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and innovations in the tech realm.
